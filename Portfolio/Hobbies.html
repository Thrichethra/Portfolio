                <h2>Cake Baking</h2>
                <p>I learned how to bake during the COVID-19 lockdown, and in my free time, 
                    I started baking cupcakes. They turned out perfectly, and my family really enjoyed them. 
                    Since then, I have continued baking regularly. and For my last year birthday 
                    and my father's birthday, I even baked cakes for the occasions. I really enjoy baking! I've attached some photos here</p>

                <h2>Stitch Dresses</h2>
                <p>I started stitching dresses during the COVID-19 lockdown because I could not buy a dress
                    for my birthday due to restrictions. I stitched a frock, and it turned out perfectly. 
                    Since then, I have continued stitching and even started a small business, earning 10,000 rupees. 
                    I am really happy with this accomplishment. Here, I have attached some pictures of the dresses Ihave stitched</p>
